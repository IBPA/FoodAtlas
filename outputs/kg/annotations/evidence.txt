e1139	r0	e1262	(e1139,r0,e1262)	34681526	PMC8535699		RESULTS	In nature, chlorophyll molecules are present in several forms, with the most common being a and b. While chlorophyll a is characteristic of plants that are more exposed to light, concentrations of chlorophyll a and b depend on the plant's age and environmental factors, such as light exposure, temperature, relative humidity, etc.. In the majority of T. vulgaris and M. communis extracts obtained in the current study, the content of chlorophyll a and its derivatives was higher, while S. officinalis, L. nobilis and P. lentiscus extracts, in general, contained more chlorophyll b. Similar findings were reported by Lafeuille et al., who found 4.55 mg 100 g-1 of chlorophyll b and 0.46 mg 100 g-1 of chlorophyll a in marjoram, and 11.65 mg 100 g-1 of chlorophyll b and 13.79 mg 100 g-1 of chlorophyll a in oregano leaves.	oregano contains chlorophyll	FoodAtlas:annotation	high
