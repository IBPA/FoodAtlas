4829	The 2.3- to 2.4-fold-differences in Alaska blackfish TDC, TPF, T0.5R, Raterise and Rate50% relax over the 10 C acclimation temperature difference (calculated from all strips at Baseline) are comparable to the Q10 of 2.2 for the decrease in standard total oxygen consumption (i.e., from air and water) displayed by Alaska blackfish with acclimation to 5 C from 15 C. This finding, combined with the fact that TDC, TPF, Raterise and Rate50% relax did not differ between 15 C and 5 C Untreated strips when measured at 10 C, suggests that acute and perhaps direct temperature effects largely account for the differences in the contractile parameters between acclimation temperatures.
