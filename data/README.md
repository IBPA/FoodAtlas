## Data

This directory contains data necessary for the FoodAtlas framework. Many of the data files in our work is already pushed to our GitHub repository. However, you still have to download some large files. Please refer to the instructions below on how to reproduce these results.

### Download and process data
```
./download_and_process_data.sh
```

### Comments
For the NCBI taxonomy, our original work used the new_taxdump.zip from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/, which was accessed on 11/30/2022 at 9:53 AM. For updated results, we recommend using the latest dataset as some entries do expire.

For FooDB, we downloaded the files from the link: https://foodb.ca/public/system/downloads/foodb_2020_4_7_csv.tar.gz.
